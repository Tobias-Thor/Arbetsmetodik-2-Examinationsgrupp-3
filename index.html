        <p>Welcome to Taverna – A New Era of Flavor and Community!

            With over 40 years of culinary excellence, 
            Taverna is stepping into the future with 
            a new concept and renewed passion. 
            From the classic tastes of Italian cuisine 
            to a bold transformation – we are proud to 
            introduce our new focus: 
            American BBQ at its finest.
        
            Under the leadership of new owners, 
            Taverna has been revitalized, 
            where tradition meets innovation. 
            Here, you’re invited into a world of 
            sizzling grills, juicy cuts of meat, 
            and rich flavors that evoke the heart 
            of the American South. Every dish is 
            crafted with care and fire, using only 
            the finest ingredients to create an 
            authentic BBQ experience.
        
            Our ambiance is as tasteful as our food 
            – a harmonious blend of modern design 
            and rustic charm. You’ll find a relaxed 
            atmosphere that makes every visit memorable, 
            whether it’s for a family dinner, an 
            after-work gathering, or a festive evening 
            with friends.</p>
